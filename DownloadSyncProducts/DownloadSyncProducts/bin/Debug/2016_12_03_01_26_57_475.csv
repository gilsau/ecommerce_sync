Because it doesn't have a mainspring, the P3 can also be dry-fired. If you want to increase your accuracy and trigger control, dry-firing can help you do that.Unlike many production pistols, the P3 is made of quality materials. Manufactured by the legendary Weihrauch factory in Germany, this air pistol has a rifled steel barrel. In fact, all critical mechanisms are made of ordnance steel, while the exterior shell is made of tough, durable polymers.Whether you shoot right-handed, left-handed, single-handed or two-handed, the Beeman P3 can accommodate you! The ambidextrous design and the functionality of the cocking mechanism are convenient no matter what style of shooting you enjoy.Accuracy is 0.20"" center-to-center. You won't find too many pistols in this price range that can brag about that kind of accuracy! The P3 is perfect for 10-meter target shooting, but you'll end up doing a lot more with the gun.

Do Not store batteries in a manner that will allow the terminals to short circuit. Store batteries at temperatures below 90 degrees Fahrenheit & above 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  Do not place batteries near heating sources or expose to direct sunlight for long periods of time. Elevated temperatures may shorten the service life of the battery. Use LiPo battery chargers of the appropriate voltage when charging. Follow instructions provided by the battery charger. An improperly charged battery may cause a fire as well as damage to the battery. Do not disassemble a LiPo battery. If battery is unintentionally destroyed, use thick rubber gloves to handle battery contents & avoid inhalation of vapors that may be emmitted. Do not short circuit a LiPo battery. Short circuits can overheat the terminals and have the potential to cause a fire. Extended short circuiting creates high temperatures at the terminals and may cause skin burns if touched.
